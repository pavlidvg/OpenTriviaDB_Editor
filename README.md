# OpenTriviaDB_Editor
A simple GUI that can open, edit or create simple trivia questions according to the OpenTriviaDB schema. Still a work in progress but certainly functional

# About the project
This editor is built with the intention of making a simple, fast and open source way to create and play your own trivia games, or share fun facts about a topic that interests you. 
The files that this project creates and opens are (so far at least) simple JSON Objects following the schema that the OpenTrivia Database API would give. Therefore, the trivia
questions created are already compatible with most projects that can read OpenTrivia questions, as well as our web=based implementantion we will soon be sharing.

# Contributing
If you stumbled on this project and feel like you could help feel free to open an issue. The project needs a lot of work as there are missing features, a few known bugs 
and does not have a good enough development guide. I am planning to make Open source development much easier in the future, but for the next few months there are other preiorities
in development.
